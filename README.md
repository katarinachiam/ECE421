# ECE421
Assignments for ECE421: Introduction to Machine Learning

**Assignment 1: Binary Logistic Regression Classifier**
* created a simple logistic regression classifier using numpy by applying stochastic gradient descent on the MNIST dataset of handwritten letters C and J
* created a simple logistic regression classifier using tensorflow v1.x by applying stochastic gradient descent and ADAM optimization on the MNIST dataset of handwritten letters C and J
* investigated hyperparameters to achieve optimal validation accuracy

**Assignment 2: Multi-class Logistic Regression Classifier**
* created a multi-class neural network model using numpy by optimizing average cross-entropy loss and backpropagation derivation on the notMNIST dataset of letters from A to J in different fonts 

**Assignment 3: Unsupervised Learning and Probabilistic Models**
* implemented K-means clustering with Adam optimization and experimented with different number of clusters to find local optimum for l2-loss
* implemented Mixture of Gaussians model to incorporate a probabilistic approach and experimented with different number of clusters to find local optimum for l2-loss
